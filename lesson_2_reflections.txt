What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-- A .git (hidden file) is created
-- This enables all the underlying code to work, allowing you to create commits (track work), see status, etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-- The staging area is your index area or the "loading dock". Maybe even the experimental area where you can make the changes you want, ensure all the "inventory" is there and then commit. The working directory is your current view. The staging area has files in it that will change. The repository tracks all the changes (commits).

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
-- You could track your changes with git diff and git diff --staging. 
-- But more specifically you can make changes 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
-- ability to try out different things or experiment while not messing with the master
-- maybe create new messaging to test?
-- different languages
-- new features 
-- test coding

-- Master branch is the production ready branch. Other branches are great for experimenting. Use them for contextual switches/changes. E.g., if fixing a bus. Use a branch to avoid messing up the master.
-- If multiple people are working at the same time, each can create their own branch, work simultaneous w/o impacting the other.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
-- Provides a visual understanding of location or how to find commits. The linear or non-linear visual explanation of changes made to the different branches.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
-- Brings together changes into one single play. Limits the # of branches to track. 
-- Diagram is great to visualize the structure, identify the commits for each branch (linear), and where to merge each branch when needed. Pretty clean.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
-- automatic merging pulls all the commits in itself but it might not be as specific or detailed, or understanding of what all should or should not be included. The good thing is that it flags potential conflicts.
-- Manually takes more time but you can be more hands-on and aware and selective of what should be merged.
